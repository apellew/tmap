We continue to meet regularly on a Thursday afternoon from 1.30 until 3.00pm at The Octagon. All are welcome.
As a well established friendly group, we enjoy knitting and are all very good at “nattering”.
Our aim has always been to welcome and encourage people to join and meet old friends and make new ones. Also to encourage people to use their knitting skills to make things that other people need anywhere there is a need. 
We are always very grateful for donations of wool for our projects if anyone has any spare. Thank you for recent donations they are greatly appreciated.
During our afternoons together, as well as knitting and nattering, we have a regular exercise slot when Wendy keeps us stretched and strengthened with fun exercises. (soon after that we have tea and cakes !!)
Are you interested in joining us? Either phone me or just turn up on a Thursday afternoon. We look forward to seeing some new faces as well as our lovely familiar ones. P.S. You don’t have to be able to knit to join us, we are very happy with nattering.

The programme includes music, puppetry, dance, circus, theatre, storytelling and workshops in arts, crafts and much more. With 43 events hosted in 23 venues across the county, there is sure to be something for everyone.
Events in your area include: Three Little Pigs (Puppetry), Folk Tales & Fiddles (Music & Storytelling) and Havisham (Theatre). Additionally, we have workshops with Mosaic and Crochet Flower Making.
Thanks to Arts Council England funding, tickets are affordably priced between £2 and £10, with concessions available.
Guests can look forward to a unique and intimate experience, quite unlike anything offered by a traditional theatre or larger entertainment venue. Everyone is welcome - we aim to make our activities as welcoming and accessible as possible.
Tickets are on sale, pick up a brochure and purchase tickets in participating libraries and online www.library.live/the-library-presents.', -- description

Our next meeting is on Saturday 12th October, and the following one will be on 9th November.  Meetings are held in the Octagon at 10.30 am and refreshments are provided.
We will be pleased to see you if you are a regular member, a new member or if you have never been before.
Autumn is now upon us, and the clocks will soon be going back. If you find this a challenging time you are very welcome to come along and meet others who may be in a similar position.
We are a very welcoming group where you can talk freely and where your confidence will be respected. There will be time to share your experiences, join in discussions and get to know others in the group. 
If you are not sure if the group is right for you, please phone one of us to discuss it.  We welcome all newcomers but would ask that you come at 10am so that we can explain the format.
The leaders, who are CRUSE trained, and the other members of the group will offer a warm welcome, and you will meet other people who have been through loss and who understand the pain and difficulties that this brings.
For more details, telephone Sue Kenchington at 780260, Chris Stannard at 781978, or Maggie Cox at 488657.', -- description

More opportunities to walk, wheel and cycle?
The County Council is looking to improve the quality, extent and connectedness of footpaths and cycleways to ensure that people are able to consider walking, wheeling or cycling more often, and have realistic alternatives to driving. For Bar Hill this can include linking up the sections of path around the perimeter road, for safer walking, wheeling and cycling, and also potentially making the link to Dry Drayton more cycle-friendly and thus a realistic alternative to car driving.
Soon the county will be conducting a survey in Bar Hill and Dry Drayton, to find out more information about how people wish to make journeys or use the footpaths. This will help provide an evidence base which can then support bids for funding to – amongst other things – complete the path around the ring road, perhaps also highlight specific issues which act as barriers to more walking, wheeling and cycling in and around the village. 
Please do look out for news that the survey is live and it would be helpful if as many people completed it as possible. The more evidence there is of need and demand the stronger the case for funding initiatives will be. The plan is to have the survey online (there is a site called ‘Consult Cambridgeshire’) plus there could be paper copies available at the library and GP surgery for people to fill in who find online surveys inconvenient. It won’t immediately deliver results but it is a really important step towards achieving change, and it is really encouraging that this will be a model for other areas across the county too. 
School Streets
The School Street Initiative involves giving a road outside a school a temporary restriction on motorised traffic at school drop-off and pick-up times. Areas adopting this approach show results include a safer, healthier and more pleasant environment for everyone involved. This is being considered in Bar Hill for Gladeside, to ensure the safety of children and families during busy periods. 
The reason the scheme is needed is that there are many reports of concerning driving and manoeuvres near Bar Hill Primary School. Council staff heard from the headteacher and others accounts of numerous near misses involving school children at the hammerhead where vehicles attempt to turn around. Typically upwards of twenty vehicles parked in this location during school drop-off and pick-up times, with many vehicles trying to turn around simultaneously. There was also dangerous parking across the uncontrolled crossing point outside the library, and one vehicle was seen performing a multiple point turn and reversing up the footway into the Tesco car park to turn around.
Implementing a School Street on Gladeside would not only eliminate these dangerous occurrences near the school but also create a safer space for parents and children walking from their parked vehicles in the Tesco car park. The idea is that for certain periods there would be limited vehicle access to Gladeside (only allowing residents, blue badge holders (and SEND), and deliveries) – thus creating a safer environment for everyone. It looks like a good scheme which should get support!', -- description

CraftsShed members continue to meet in the Octagon Meetings Room, on Thursday Mornings from 0930 to 1230. Whilst extremely grateful to the Leadership of Bar Hill Church for letting us do this we still require new accommodation. We are working with both the Parish Council and County Council to help find and secure a suitable venue.  The new storage shed has been erected behind the Octagon. This has been funded by a “Community Chest Grant” from South Cambridgeshire District Council for which we are extremely grateful.
CraftsShed is a Registered Charity supporting our local Community. Many various benches have had a makeover in our village in the Childrens’ Playground, Tennis Courts, Allotment Society and also near to the Scout Hut. Other items repaired / upgraded are a Rocking Chair, Garden BBQ Trolley. Recently some Members worked on a project for the Bar Hill Pre School assembling a much needed seating area for the children around the tree. Please visit our Website @ https://craftsshedbh.wixsite.com/barhill
Individuals will continue to help make items, and as a group we will undertake small projects for our Community. The new shed which is for storage only will enable us to continue to make items. 
On a Thursday Morning there will be a display outside of the Octagon weather permitting. We have some second-hand tools that will be available to sell for a donation
We don’t only meet for coffee / tea but also arrange a trip out to places of interest. As you read this we will have visited the Fitzwilliam Museum looking at wooden tools in Egyptian times. If you are over 18 and would like to come and join us, please contact Chris or Nick below.
If you would like further information please call Chris Stannard 07711 623425 or Nick Gunton on 07484 2555214', -- description

  'In September, we welcomed our new families to the Preschool and started our topic ’All About Me’, drawing pictures of ourselves and our families. We have looked at the colour of our eyes and hair, and thought about how we are all unique in what we look like and what we like to do. 
The older children have started their PE lessons, and the ’letters and sounds’ programme, starting with tuning into their listening skills. 
The children have enjoyed role playing ’teachers’, showing great skills of retelling familiar story books. They have also enjoyed role playing as ’doctors’, knowing the purpose of each instrument and able to make teddy bears, and the adults, better in their play. We have, also, looked at colour mixing.
The children have enjoyed helping each other to gather materials to use in the ’mud kitchen’. 
As the end of the month approaches, we will participate in a ’Macmillian Coffee Morning’ with our families. 
Do you have a child who will be four years old by 31/08/2025, the portal is now open to apply for your child’s primary school place to start in September 2025. Please see www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/admissions for further information.  
Bar Hill Preschool opens term time only and offers places the term after a child’s second birthday.

  'BAR HILL LIBRARY - October 2024
We have plenty going on this month at Bar Hill Library, including some exciting events for families and children.
Green Libraries Week
Cambridgeshire Libraries are committed to being as sustainable as possible. Did you know that you can borrow not only books but also jigsaw puzzles, audio books and various online resources? These are resources which are borrowed and re-used by multiple members across the county.
Green Libraries Week takes place from 7th to 12th October. Keep an eye out for our displays and look for posters and social media posts about sustainable craft events.
Half-term crafts
From time to time, books in the library service become damaged as they have been used so many times. These have to be taken out of circulation and are sent to be recycled if they are unable to be used in another way.
We have retained some of these to use for craft activities such as making these adorable hedgehogs. Look for our posters and social media posts about children’s half-term crafts. 
Save the date
On Saturday 23rd November, we will be hosting the Garlic Theatre group and their puppet production of Three Little Pig Tails from 3pm. Suitable for families, this is a bookable event and details can be found at https://www.library.live/the-library-presents or on our posters and social media.
Regular Events
Stay & Play (for very young children) - every Monday in term time.  10-11am
Rhymetime (singing for babies and toddlers) - every Tuesday.  2.30-3pm
Lego Club - on the 2nd Wednesday of each month (in term time).  3.30-4.45pm
Family History drop-in session - on the 3rd Monday of each month.  2-4.30pm', -- description

  'Helping Hedgehogs in October
In October, hedgehogs are preparing for hibernation, so it’s important to help them by ensuring they have access to food, shelter, and safety. You can:
1. Provide food: Leave out meaty cat or dog food, or special hedgehog food, along with fresh water. Avoid milk and bread. Hedgehogs are lactose intolerant. 
2. Create Shelter First: Build or buy a hedgehog house or leave piles of logs and leaves where they can nest.
3. Ensure safe passage: Make gaps in fences to help hedgehogs roam freely.
4. Avoid hazards: Be cautious when using garden tools, and check bonfire piles. 
These steps will support hedgehogs in your garden as they prepare for winter.

Many thanks to the Team, for all those that continue to weed, water the garden as required, your help is appreciated, particularly during my period of incapacity.
The Seasons are changing to Autumn, when we will see the lovely colours of the Autumn leaves, before they drop their leaves.
At long last as we prepare this article a local Landscaping company is replacing the upright sleepers for the two beds. All the plaques have been removed, and have been polished ready for fixing to the new timbers. The work that is in progress has shown that we will need to restore the area. Re barking (mulch)will also be necessary. The cost for this is in the region of £400.
For the timbers we have received financial help from The Parish Council , The Community Association,  South Cambridgeshire District Council Community Chest, The Co-Op. for which we are extremely grateful.
However, can “YOU” also help financially towards the costs. Cheques may be left at 7 Acorn Avenue made payable to Bar Hill Memorial Garden or alternatively paid directly into Bar Hill Memorial Account at the Cambridge Building Society Account Number 1768402740 If you wish to talk to someone re a donation then please phone Chris on the numbers below. Thank you to those who have given financial support for this work.

Bar Hill finished the season on a high with two wins from the final league matches.
In the first of those matches, Bar Hill batted first against Cambourne IV and totalled 203 for 4. The runs were shared around, Jacob Marshall-Grint scoring 39 and James Neal 37 and three more scoring in the 20s. In reply, one of the Cambourne openers scored 62, but wickets fell regularly and they were eventually all out for 178. Phil Orvis took three wickets and there were two each for Febin Jamal and Asmat Ali.
Cam Kerala III had the better of the second match of the month, though Bar Hill did bowl them out for 190, with three wickets to Jacob and two each for Phil Orvis and Jake Curry. In reply, Bar Hill got off to a poor start, falling to 8 for 3, and eventually ended up with 98 all out. The top scorer was Febin with 30.
The final match saw victory in a thrilling match at Comberton, with Febin playing a key role. He first took 3 wickets for just nine runs in six overs as Comberton posted 169 for 7. There were also two wickets for Jeemon Vazhappily. In reply, Lijin Jolly scored 33 to give Bar Hill a good start, but wickets fell to leave us on 85 for 5. Febin then took over, hitting two sixes and 10 fours in an unbeaten 76, while Jeemon added 34 not out and they added 85 together to see Bar Hill to the target of 170 off the first ball of the final over.
The other match of the month, the return against Cam Kerala, was rained off, which means Bar Hill finished third in the table, behind champions Cam Kerala and Cambridge St Giles III, who were also in the promotion places.
The final action of the season saw the annual match against the Social Club, who fielded a strong team including several former BHCC players, and were deserved winners.
By the time you read this, we will have ‘put the pitch to bed’ for the winter and held our presentation night – details of the award winners in next month’s edition.

  'In my June Bar Hill News article I highlighted the declining numbers of people joining the Club and the danger of the Club ceasing to exist. However we continue to explore ways to support the future of the Club including the possibility of using and adapting the courts to include the playing of pickleball. Two of our members have been promoting pickleball during the summer and the regular sessions have been well attended.
Is a joint tennis / pickleball Club with resurfaced and relined courts the way forward? We invite you to an open meeting at the Social Club 19.30 on Wednesday 6th November to discuss the future of the Club. All members and anyone interested in tennis or pickleball are invited.
Have you taken advantage of our reduced winter memberships? This will allow you to play at any time from 1 September through to 31.3.25: Adult: £25, Junior: £5, Family: £45. Floodlights use per session £5 (booked via website).
For full details of our very competitive membership fees please visit our web site or contact us using the details below.
Membership entitles you to play at anytime but the courts are also available to hire for private play. Membership applications and individual court hires can all be booked and paid for “on line” via our website.
It might be autumn but subject to weather you may well still see members playing on our Tuesday or Thursday Club nights (18.30 – 21.00). Why not try tennis to warm you up on those colder but dry autumn nights!

  'On behalf of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority I wanted to make sure that you are aware of the launch of the Tiger bus pass, offering bus fares for just £1 for those under 25. This could be a vital tool for young people to access a range of opportunities across our region for just £1 over the summer break.
 The new Tiger bus pass is free of charge and designed to make public transport more affordable for young people, helping them travel to school, college, training, work, shopping, and social activities.. This initiative is part of a broader effort by the Combined Authority to revamp public transport in the region.

  'Bar Hill Childminders are all graded ‘Good’ on their latest inspections, are fully insured and have Paediatric First Aid training.  We offer quality, caring, home from home care with a wide range of exciting experiences for the children, both within our settings and the local community.
 We regularly go on walks, outings and attend local groups to help the children socialise. We find having a wide range of ages benefits all the children in our care, it helps the younger children’s confidence and encourages the older children to be patient and understanding with the younger children, helping them learn and progress. 
We accept the 2,3 and 4 year funding and the Government Tax Free Childcare payments. 
As we are busy during the day with the children, please text us your enquiry with details of your requirements and we will contact you as soon as possible with our up to date availability and hourly rates. 
Jacky – 07718447998 – ages 6 months upwards. Term time only and all year round care offered. Spaces expected from Sept 2024.
Kirsten – 07906218070 – ages 6 months upwards. Term time only and all year round care offered. No current vacancies.
The new term is well under way now and we’re back into our routines. We have had some children move on to school now and they are settling in well. One really interesting thing we did during the school holidays was to visit the Cambridge Science Centre where we experimented with light, gravity, flight, magnetism, robots etc and learnt about the digestive system.
We are enjoying our walks and are keeping an eye out for the signs that autumn is here we have seen the conkers grow and ripen, we have enjoyed picking and eating the juicy blackberries and we’ve seen acorns growing on the oak trees.
We’ll use conkers to explore in paint, seeing what patterns we can make as they roll around and for counting and comparing sizes. We also talk about hibernation, how some animals sleep during the colder months and how we can help feed the birds and other animals that visit our gardens. 
In October we will also be looking at pumpkins and seeing the different sizes and cutting some open to see what they are like inside. There may also be some spooky crafts going on! November is a very busy month with lots of special days and celebrations. We have Diwali, Firework night, Remembrance Day, Nursery Rhyme week and Road Safety week.
